      <description>The first time I read the Gang of Four Design Patterns book, I was impressed, no blown away, by the brilliance of what I was reading. The Visitor pattern utilizing double-dispatch. Brilliant. Chain of Responsibility. Why didn&#39;t I think of that? Adapter. Simple and powerful.
Of course I was itching to start implementing these patterns. In practice though they seemed to be applicable only in rare situations. Adapter, Builder, Factory, Strategy, were the most useful.</description>

      <description>When I read about F# object expressions, the first thought that popped into my head was to use them to create mocks for unit tests.&amp;nbsp; For those of you who are not familiar with object expressions, they are similar to anonymous classes in Java.&amp;nbsp; They are the object equivalent of lambda functions, and they allow you to create objects that implement an interface or base class without having to declare a new class.</description>
