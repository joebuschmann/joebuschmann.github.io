      <description>I have worked extensively with WinForms and WPF/Silverlight and noticed that docking/dock panels are not used that often.&amp;#160; At least this is the case where I work.&amp;#160; I find this surprising given their power and ease of use.
Using XAML, why would a programmer choose a complex Grid/StackPanel setup over a DockPanel?&amp;#160; Or on the WinForms side, set the anchor properties for control rather than simplify things with the dock property?</description>

      <title>Creating a Crawl Control in WPF</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was watching CNN when an interesting blurb scrolled by on the crawl at the bottom of the screen.&amp;nbsp; Normally, the crawl is not something I notice, but I thought to myself, &#34;I wonder if I can implement one in WPF.&#34;&amp;nbsp; I had never done any animations before in WPF, and this seemed like a good way to start.
So I gave it a shot.
My initial instinct was to bring up Google and see if anyone else had done it.</description>
