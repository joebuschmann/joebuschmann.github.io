      <description>2014 has been a fantastic year for me professionally. I spent the majority of the year working on a green field project with a great group of co-workers. I was the Scrummaster for a talented team and wrote a lot of Angular.js and Javascript. Ultimately the project was cancelled, and its members were merged into another group. While disappointing, it led me to a new opportunity as a Product Owner and lead architect for a team tasked with creating a test framework built on Specflow.</description>
