      <description>During the run-up to the 2016 election, one word was often used to describe Donald Trump: sociopath. Just Google donald trump sociopath, and you&#39;ll find the results full of articles asking if he really is a sociopath. His former ghostwriter Tony Schwartz thinks so.
Amid all the sociopath talk, I realized I didn&#39;t know what the word meant. To me it just described a horrible person. I decided to fix that and read up on sociopathy and its close cousin psychopathy.</description>
