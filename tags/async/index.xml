      <description>In the latest versions of the .NET Framework, asynchronous work is represented by the Task class. A task is similar to a future or promise in other languages. You can create one in many ways the most common being Task.Run(). The result of a task is exposed by the Task.Result property. If the work is complete, then the property immediately returns a value; otherwise, it blocks until the operation is finished.</description>

      <description>Task.Run You can use Task.Run to schedule a delegate to run on the thread pool. The method returns a new task, and if the work is complete, the result will be available via Task.Result. If not, Task.Result will block until it is complete.

      <title>Async/Await and Recursion</title>

      <description>While using the new async/await keywords in C# 5.0 for the first time, I noticed an interesting aspect to how recursive methods behave when using await. For one method I was working on, Resharper notified me of a possible stack overflow exception with a &amp;ldquo;function is recursive on all paths&amp;rdquo; warning, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t fail at runtime. Instead, it continued happily calling itself with no issues.
What keeps it from failing is the use of the await keyword when calling DoWorkAsync().</description>
