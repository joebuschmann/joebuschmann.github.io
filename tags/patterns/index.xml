      <description>The first time I read the Gang of Four Design Patterns book, I was impressed, no blown away, by the brilliance of what I was reading.┬á The Visitor pattern utilizing double-dispatch.┬á Brilliant.┬á Chain of Responsibility.┬á Why didn&#39;t I think of that?┬á Adapter.┬á Simple and powerful.
Of course I was itching to start implementing these patterns.┬á In practice though they seemed to be applicable only in rare situations.┬á Adapter, Builder, Factory, Strategy, were the most useful.</description>
