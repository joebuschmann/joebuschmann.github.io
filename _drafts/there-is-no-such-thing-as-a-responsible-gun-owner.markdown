>It's just like a mule. A mule is a docile, patient beast, and he will give you power to pull a plow for decades, but he wants to kill you. He waits for years and years for that rare, opportune moment when he can turn your lights out with a simple kick to the head.
>Jerry Poole, referring to a nuclear power reactor

The responsible gun owner is a trite idea that gets thrown out into the gun debate after each mass shooting. Pro-gun activists lament that responsible gun owners are punished for the sins of others. If only we had better training, if only people took personal responsibility, then there would be fewer shootings. Every accident gets poo-pooed by pro-gun advocates because the vicitms were not **Responsible Gun Owners**&trade;.

Well, I'm convinced there's no such thing as a responsible gun owner. Sure, there are gun owners who are more responsible than others, but there's no one who's perfect. No one who deserves the title Responsible Gun Owner. The problem with guns is they are so dangerous that they require perfection, and no one is perfect.

Recently I finished the book _Atomic Accidents: A History of Nuclear Meltdowns and Disasters_ by James Mahaffey. It's a facinating book that covers the details of nuclear accidents and why they occurred. As I was reading it, I was struck by how easily billiant engineers and physicists could make sloppy mistakes. They worked with materials they knew to be dangerous, but in many cases were very cavalier about how they handled them. These were men (literally, they were all men) at the top of their game who occasionally managed to injure and sometimes kill themselves due to careless mistakes.

Take the case of Harry Daghlian, a physicist with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. On August 21, 1945, he was working on a criticality experiment that involved tungsten carbide bricks stacked around a plutonium core. He inadvertently dropped a brick onto the core, and it went prompt critical, meaning it released a dangerous dose of radiation. He was irradiated with a fatal dose of neutron radiation. Twenty-five days later he passed away. His death due to acute radiation syndrome was not pleasant.

These brilliant well-trained physicists are the responsible gun owners of the nuclear world. Owning a gun, much like working with plutonium, can be routine. Years go by and nothing happens. The gun becomes routine. The responsible gun owner grows complacent until *boom*, the gun reveals its violent nature.

We're all human. We all make mistakes. If you own a gun long enough, you're gonna screw up. Take [the case of a Florida mother](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/09/us/gun-activist-shot-florida/index.html) who was accidentally shot by her young son. By all accounts she was the prototypical responsible gun owner. She was well trained, kept her guns locked up, taught her son about the dangers of guns. Then one day she is rushing about and forgets to store her handgun safely. As she is driving, the gun slides under her seat into the back of the truck. Her son picks it up and shoots her in the back.

Or consider the [death of Lana Ray Meisner](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/07/entertainment/randy-meisner-wife-shooting-feat/), the wife of Eagles co-founder Randy Meisner. She was moving a rifle in its case, and it accidentally discharged. These tragedies have one thing in common. Responsible gun owners died due to a careless mistake.

The funny thing about guns is they don't care that you're sick or tired or busy. They don't care about your training. As a gun owner, you don't have the luxury of an off day because simple mistakes come with serious consequences. You cannot make a mistake, ever, or people can die.

There's no such thing as a responsible gun owner.
