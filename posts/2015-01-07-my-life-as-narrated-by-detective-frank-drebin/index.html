    <h1 class="title">My life as narrated by Lieutenant Frank Drebin</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>Like many others I lead an ordinary life. Up at dawn, get the kids ready, then my wife and I head to work. To spice up the story of my life, I enlisted the help of Lieutenant Frank Drebin. Follow along as the Police Squad operative narrates my life with bad puns and worse metaphors.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.joebuschmann.com/frank_drebin_1.jpg" alt="Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad!"></p>
<h4 id="dawn">Dawn</h4>
<p>The day started like any other. With a clean shave and a dirty diaper. Not mine, but my son's. You see, I'm a father of two and a mother of none. Each morning I get my son ready for daycare, and like any other morning, I walked into his room and flipped on the light. He squinted at the ceiling, confused and bewildered. Like Sarah Palin in a science classroom. Or anywhere for that matter.</p>
<p>As I changed his diaper, I noticed his left testicle was still undecended. &ldquo;Unusual but not unheard of.&rdquo; At least that's what his urologist Dr. Prickman told us.</p>
<h4 id="the-train-station">The Train Station</h4>
<p>The train station had a musty odor after last night's rain. The cracks in the concrete slowly leaked water down the stained walls. I made my way up the stairs like any other morning and caught sight of a grey heap lying haphazardly on the ground. I picked it up. It was a cardigan. A light weave. Made for late spring or early fall. With the scent of purfume from days long past.</p>
<p>I continued up the stairs holding the knitted garment. Someone had dropped it. And I was going to find out who.</p>
<p>The station was slow for a Monday morning. People milled about staring at their smartphones. Giggling over the mundane musings of friends&hellip;and kittens. I scanned the platform looking for this mystery lady. How would I find her? No doubt that a sophisticated anaysis of security footage would reveal the owner. But I didn't have time for sophisticated. The train was quickly approaching. Soon the moment would be lost. I had to act fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone lose a sweater?&rdquo; I yelled. A bent woman slowly shuffled toward me. &ldquo;Thank you sir&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>You're welcome lady. You're welcome.</p>
<h4 id="the-office">The Office</h4>
<p>I stepped off the elevator and stepped into a maze of cubicles. Row after row, line after line. Like a bolo tie on a fat man, I felt small and insignificant.</p>
<p>Walking toward my desk, I passed the usual suspects. The guy who insisted on signing his name with the Roman numeral &ldquo;III&rdquo; at the end. Next to him was a guy who told Asian jokes and said it was okay because he's a quarter Asian. Well, the other three quarters is an asshole.</p>
<p>I turned a corner and passed a software developer who said I reminded him of Steve Martin. He did the Egyptian walk whenever we passed in the hall. At the office Christmas party, he said he would buy me a ukulele. I'm still waiting.</p>
<p>Then there was the young lady in the back. She was from Minnesota, and yes, she was nice.</p>
<p>I sat at my desk trying to recover from the commute when I heard my boss one cube over talking on the phone in Icelandic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Icelandic, Icelandic, Icelandic] reboot [Icelandic] start button.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Must be helping his mom with her computer again.</p>
<h4 id="story-time">Story Time</h4>
<p>As I read the author's so called account, I began to get suspicious. My daughter sat looking at the book in rapt attention, unaware of my doubts. I kept them to myself. It was better that way.</p>
<p>You see, the author's tale was full of holes. Like a giant block of swiss cheese run through by rabid mice. It claimed that Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. That's right. Pickled. Everyone knows that peppers come off the vine fresh. The pickling happens after they've been picked. But Peter Piper was picking &lsquo;em pre-pickled. And I smelled a rat.</p>
<p>Why was this author presenting a different version of the facts? Perhaps she suspected the children wouldn't wise up? Well, she didn't expect me. I pressed on page by page. I needed to find out more about this Peter fella.</p>
<h4 id="xbox-on">XBox On</h4>
<p>Xbox on.
Xbox on!</p>
<p>It was a typical week night in sleepy suburban town. Mary and I settled down to watch a movie. We chose an old English yarn. Full of graceful ladies with smooshed boobs enduring the trials of courtship in 18th century England.</p>
<p>Xbox on!</p>
<p>Damn Xbox. Our entire entertainment system depended on it. TV, blu-ray, DVD, on-demand, it controlled everything. The Skynet of our house. And it was refusing to respond to voice commands.</p>
<p>Where's Siri when you need her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's use the remote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't find it. Try the game controller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game controller? Can you just get up and push the button?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reluctantly got up and moved toward the XBox. My finger shook slightly as it pressed the button.</p>
<p>Da-dink! Success!</p>
<p>I settled back down with my wife, ready to relax.</p>
<p>XBox play.
XBox play!
XBox play! XBox play! XBox play!</p>
<h4 id="seduction">Seduction</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Hello doll&rdquo; I said as she swept through the bedroom door riding a pair of impossibly long legs. The curve of her neck stretched toward the ceiling. Like one of those African ladies. With the metal coils.</p>
<p>You see, it had been a long time since I'd seen the inside of a pair of frilly panties. And I wanted to take complete advantage of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm gonna brush my teeth and get to bed&rdquo; Mary said. &ldquo;Oh, you forgot to take out the trash. And rotate the laundry while you're down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things weren't going the way I expected. I was about to protest when I realized that, yes, I had indeed forgotten to take out the trash.</p>
<p>The trashcan scraped along the driveway as I dragged it to the curb. It was a bright night in a dark town. In the distance cicadas droned on with their shrill mating call. But it worked for them. Can't say the same for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello doll?&rdquo; What was I thinking? She was a sophisticated lady immune to cheap one liners.</p>
<p>I had to rethink my plan before the night got away. I turned around and looked up at the warm glow of the windows. Suddenly the lights flickered off.</p>
<p>Seduction ain't easy.</p>
