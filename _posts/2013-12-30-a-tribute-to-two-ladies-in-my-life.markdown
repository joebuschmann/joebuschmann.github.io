I'd like to take a break from my usual tech writing to bring you a very special holiday post. There are two ladies in my life that make each day better than the last, and I want to thank them for making 2013 a great year. My wife, Mary, has been with me for almost 10 years, and we're still best friends. My daughter, Emilia, just turned four. She is a little lady who turns every day into an adventure.

Please enjoy the slide show and have a great new year.
