While I don't use the [Fit.js](https://github.com/soulwire/fit.js) javascript library in my day-to-day work, I was struck by its simple and effective documentation. Check out the [README](https://github.com/soulwire/fit.js/blob/master/README.md) and [demo page](http://soulwire.github.io/fit.js/). In just minutes, you can read the doc and know exactly what the library is and what it can do for you. Even the tagline is cool.

    fit( theThing, /* into */ theOtherThing );

This documentation style (not sure what to call it) inspired me to add a [Quick Start](https://github.com/joebuschmann/sproxy.js#quick-start) section to my own Javascript libary [SProxy](https://github.com/joebuschmann/sproxy.js) with a similar feel.
