First of all, I should clarify that the title of this post is not meant to be sarcastic. I really do enjoy public transit. It has been over 17 years since I needed to commute to work by automobile. In fact, I haven't driven to work once during that time. My daily commute consists of about two miles of walking plus a 45 minute train ride one way. I consider myself to be very lucky to have the choice not to drive.

There are times when I'll get odd questions about my commute from people who practice the automobile lifestyle. In this post, I list those questions along with my answers. Hopefully this sheds some light on the shadowy world of public transit.

> Don't you miss the freedom of a car?

It took some getting used to, but I adjusted. I traded the freedom to get up and go for the freedom from gas and repair costs. My wife and I still own a car to get around the burbs outside of work; however, our cost of ownership is down dramatically without the wear and tear of a daily commute.

> What if it rains?

I use an ancient device called an umbrella to protect myself.

> What if it's cold?

Coat and boots.

> What if you need to pick up some things on the way home?

Downtown Chicago has a Target, dozens of drugstores, and other shops.

> Are trains and buses dangerous?

They are. There is a higher chance of assault, robbery, and even murder. In fact, I was murdered five times this month alone. I've gotten accustomed to it.

Seriously though, [trains and buses are much safer than driving](http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/13/news/economy/train-plane-car-deaths/).

> Don't you get bored on the train?

Nope. Here are some things I can do during my commute that I couldn't do in a car.

* Watch a movie.
* Read a book.
* Get started on work.
* Take a nap.
* Zone out.
* Write this blog post.

> What if the zombie apocalypse begins while you're at work? How will you get away?

Not having a car will be the least of my problems.
